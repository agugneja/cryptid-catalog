  <dt style="font-weight: normal">Bigfoot is a large, dark, apelike beast that roams the forests of North America. Bigfoot may be commonly mistaken for a bear at first sight.
    However, his ferociousness and more human-like walk separates him from any typical creature. Bigfoot gets his name from the enormous size of the footprints he leaves in his tracks.
    Sightings of him report him to be seen with beating red or yellow eyes, throwing rocks, bending or breaking trees, and a skunk-like, foul odor. Additionally, Bigfoot has been known to wander the woods completely alone.
    Campers have sighted this creature the most. Due to his nighttime appearances, it is believed that Bigfoot is nocturnal. </dt>
